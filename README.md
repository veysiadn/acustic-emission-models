# Tiny Machine Learning for Damage Classification of Concrete Material Using Acoustic Emission Signals
<font size="4">This repository contains a python code for lightweight artificial neural network model, consisting of one hidden layer with four neurons, to classify damage types in concrete material using a public acoustic emission signal dataset. The model achieves 98.4% accuracy on the test data with only 4019 parameters. 
The developed model is compared with literature models and the results are presented in .
<a href="./convert_deploy.ipynb" class="header__link">convert_deploy.ipynb</a> file. After the model development the models are deployed to several microcontroller devleopment boards and comparison graphs are created for the comparison in <a href="./plots.ipynb" class="header__link">./plots.ipynb</a> file.

This Readme file will be updated with more information about the project.
